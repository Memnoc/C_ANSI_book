# Chapter One

This is mainly an intro chapter focusing on basic data structures and simple programs and arithmetic.

## character string or constant

It refers to what we normally intend as strings, so stuff like "hello world \n" where the `\n` is the newline character.
Other escape sequences include: `\t` for tab, `\b` for backspace, `\"` for the double quote and `\\` for backlash.
To be noted: the `%` weird sign that you see at the end of some `printf` without the `\n` can be avoid by actually using `printf`
If you put a width value in between `%3\d` you are effectively indenting the output of `printf`
